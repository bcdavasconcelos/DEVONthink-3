# Retrieve Bekker numbering

All of Aristotle's works are numbered according to the 1831 edition by german scholar Immanuel Bekker. This script will extract numbering matching the pattern `PAGE(1-1462) COLUMN(a|b) LINE (1-45)`, which translates into regex pattern `\d{1,4}[a|b]\d{1,2}`, and add them as aliases to the record. This is exceptionally useful if you are using automatic wiki links, as any occurrence of a reference will take you directly to the referenced work. For more information on this, see this thread [How I use Wiki-Links and Aliases (pt.2)Â ][1]. The smart-rule can be downloaded [here][2].
